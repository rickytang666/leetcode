## Description

Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return *all elements of the* `matrix` *in spiral order*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10`
* `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Well for some problems, the best way really is to come up with some algorithms for simulation. Basically, you need to simulate what the problem asks us to do.

<summary>Hint 2</summary>

We go boundary by boundary and move inwards. That is the essential operation. First row, last column, last row, first column, and then we move inwards by 1 and repeat. That's all. That is all the simulation that we need.

<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on i out of [i, j], you'll shift in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for j, you'd be shifting in the same row.
Also, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to simulate edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not.
