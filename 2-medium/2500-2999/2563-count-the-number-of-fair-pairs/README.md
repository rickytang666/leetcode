## Description

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return _the number of fair pairs_.

A pair `(i, j)` is **fair** if:

- `0 <= i < j < n`, and
- `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,7,4,4,5], lower = 3, upper = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 fair pairs: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,7,9,2,5], lower = 11, upper = 11
Output: 1
Explanation: There is a single fair pair: (2,3).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums.length == n`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= lower <= upper <= 10^9`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Sort the array in ascending order.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

For each number in the array, keep track of the smallest and largest numbers in the array that can form a fair pair with this number.
</details>

<summary>Hint 3</summary>

As you move to larger number, both boundaries move down.
