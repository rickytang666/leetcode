## Description

You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return *a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of* `searchWord` *is typed*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"].
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"].
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
Explanation: The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
* `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 104`
* All the strings of `products` are **unique**.
* `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
* `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Brute force is a good choice because length of the string is ≤ 1000.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Binary search the answer.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Use Trie data structure to store the best three matching. Traverse the Trie.
