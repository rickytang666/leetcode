## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the beginning, you are standing at index `0`, which is equal to `'0'`. You can move from index `i` to index `j` if the following conditions are fulfilled:

* `i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1)`, and
* `s[j] == '0'`.

Return `true` *if you can reach index* `s.length - 1` *in* `s`*, or* `false` *otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
Output: true
Explanation:
In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. 
In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `s[0] == '0'`
* `1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Consider for each reachable index i the interval [i + a, i + b].
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Use partial sums to mark the intervals as reachable.
